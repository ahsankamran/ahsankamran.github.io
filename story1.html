    He sat there, cigarette in one hand, a knife in the other. He was surrounded by all his accomplishments- granite carved chess sets, ivory carved murals. His dream had been to emulate Michelangelo, graduating top of his class, working part-time to pay his tuition fee and feed his parents. He was unmarried because he had no time for distractions. He has to be great. Only through hard-work would he be able to be the man his parents would be proud of. He was the one who would drag his family up from the abyss of poverty and into the limelight of decadence. </p>
<p>    He had a short fling in college at Harvard Graduate School of Design.  She was the love of his life. She was pristine and sculpted as a work of art herself. Those high cheek bones and a veneer of light textured skin encasing her delicate figure. He had a choice, marry her and forget all his dreams or leave her to pursue his dreams. Could he abandon his parents and their dreams? Would he be able to live with himself if he dragged her down with himself? He graduated, she got married. </p>

<p>    He sat there, blowing smoke out his nostrils and mouth, the knife at work in his hand. Line after line, imprecise for some reason. He was a master architect and his stability of hand was his forte. He glanced at the wall, a mahogany clock he had carved out himself last winter looked back at him with hands at 3 and 5. Looked out the window- pitch black. On his mantle-piece lay an oak frame encasing the memory of his parents. That was all that was left of him.  Resting under the frame was a letter from the Dean of Harvard- an invite to a ceremony commemorating his induction as Professor Emeritus.
